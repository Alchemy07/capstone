/home/epue/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools/_distutils/dist.py:261: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'tests_require'
  warnings.warn(msg)
error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: ['launch', 'resource', 'ros2_opencv'].

To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
setuptools will not proceed with this build.

If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
Instead, consider the following options:

1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
2. use a `src-layout`
3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names

To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
